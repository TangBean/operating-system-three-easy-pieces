# 第14章 插叙：内存操作API


## Homework (Code)

In this homework, you will gain some familiarity with memory allocation. First, you’ll write some buggy programs (fun!). Then, you’ll use
some tools to help you find the bugs you inserted. Then, you will realize
how awesome these tools are and use them in the future, thus making
yourself more happy and productive. The tools are the debugger (e.g.,
gdb) and a memory-bug detector called valgrind [SN05].

## Questions

1. First, write a simple program called null.c that creates a pointer
to an integer, sets it to NULL, and then tries to dereference it. Compile this into an executable called null. What happens when you
run this program?
2. Next, compile this program with symbol information included (with
the -g flag). Doing so let’s put more information into the executable, enabling the debugger to access more useful information
about variable names and the like. Run the program under the debugger by typing gdb null and then, once gdb is running, typing
run. What does gdb show you?
3. Finally, use the valgrind tool on this program. We’ll use the memcheck
tool that is a part of valgrind to analyze what happens. Run
this by typing in the following: valgrind --leak-check=yes
null. What happens when you run this? Can you interpret the
output from the tool?
4. Write a simple program that allocates memory using malloc() but
forgets to free it before exiting. What happens when this program
runs? Can you use gdb to find any problems with it? How about
valgrind (again with the --leak-check=yes flag)?
5. Write a program that creates an array of integers called data of size
100 using malloc; then, set data[100] to zero. What happens
when you run this program? What happens when you run this
program using valgrind? Is the program correct?
6. Create a program that allocates an array of integers (as above), frees
them, and then tries to print the value of one of the elements of
the array. Does the program run? What happens when you use
valgrind on it?
7. Now pass a funny value to free (e.g., a pointer in the middle of the
array you allocated above). What happens? Do you need tools to
find this type of problem?
